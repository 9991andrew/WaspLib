BaseScript
==========
BaseScript and it's derivants are template records to be used in scripts.
They also contain template functions and procedures that can be used as is or overriden with
"inherited" to add functionality.


------------

type TBaseScript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Record that holds common variables for most basic scripts.
The variables that are part of **TBaseScript** are the following:
 - **Name**: String that holds the script name to be displayed in the log and on screen progress report.
 - **Version**: String that holds the script version to be displayed in the log and on screen progress report.
 - **IsSetup**: Boolean that let us know if the our **TBaseScript** already set it's variables up.
 - **TimeRunning**: TStopwatch variable that holds how long our **TBaseScript** has been running.
 - **StatsDebugTick**: Integer variabled used to register the last tick we printed a progress report.
 - **Action**: String variable used to print in Simba output or on screen progress report the current action the script is performing.
 - **PreviousAction**: String variable used to register the previous action. This is used to avoid spamming the logs.
 - **ExtraInfo**: String variable we can use to print extra information in Simba output or in on screen progress report. E.G. current state of variables.
 - **ActionProfit**: Integer that holds information on how much profit (positive or negative) our script makes per action performed.
 - **TotalActions**: Integer used to count how many actions our script has done.
 - **TotalProfit**:  Integer that holds the total profit our script has done.
 - **TimeLimit**: Integer variable to set a time limit for our script in milliseconds before ending the current script.
 - **ActionLimit**: Integer variable to set total action limit before ending the script.

type TBaseWalkerScript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Record that holds common variables for most scripts that use walker.
This record inherits from **TBaseScript** and has all of it's variables too.
The extra variables that are part of **TBaseWalkerScript** are:
 - **RSW**: TRSWalker variable that holds our walker, for more information check the following page: https://ollydev.github.io/SRL-Development/walker.html?highlight=walker

type TBaseBankScript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Record that holds common variables for most scripts that use a bank.
This record inherits from **TBaseWalkerScript** and has all of it's variables as well as **TBaseScript's**.
The extra variables that are part of **TBaseBankScript** are:
 - **ScriptBank**: PRSObject pointer that points to our current bank TRSObject, for more info check: https://torwent.github.io/WaspLib/waspobject.html#type-trsobject
 - **ScriptBanker**: PRSNPC pointer that points to our current banker TRSNPC, for more info check: https://torwent.github.io/WaspLib/waspobject.html#type-trsmmdot
 - **BankTab**: Integer variable used to cache the current bank tab that contains items for our script.
 - **ItemLeftAmount**: Integer variable used to cache items left to make/build/whatever to pre-hover the bank.
 - **HoveringBank**: Boolean variable that holds information if we are currently already hovering the bank. This is so we don't try to rehover the bank and don't need to check the uptext if we already are doing it.
 - **BankEmpty**: Boolean variable that that is set to true when we ran out of an item our script needs. This is used so next time we need to fetch the item we check the deposit box instead.
 - **CollectEmpty**: Boolean variable that that is set to true when the collect box is empty. Normally, if this and **BankEmpty** are true the script ends.
 - **CollectTimer**: TCountDown variable used to reset **CollectEmpty** after a couple of minutes.
