TWaspObject
===========
Methods to handle TWaspObjects.
TWaspObjects can be anything that have a shape in the mainscreen.
They are divided in 2 main categories and one of them in 3 sub-categories:
  - RSObjects
  - MMDots:
    -RSNPCs
    -RSGroundItems
    -RSPlayers


------------

type TRSObjectSize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TRSObjectSize is the record used in **TRSObjectShape.Size**.

* **TRSObjectSize.Length**

  Length the size of the WaspObject from north to south.
  Length should be the number of tiles that the WaspObject takes in this axis.

* **TRSObjectSize.Width**

  Width the size of the WaspObject from west to east.
  Width should be the number of tiles that the WaspObject takes in this axis.

* **TRSObjectSize.Height**

  Height the size of the WaspObject from in the floor to it's top.
  There's no proper way to measure Height and the value has to be guessed, for reference, a player's or a human NPC height is roughly **6**.

type TRSObjectShape
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TRSObjectShape is the record used in **TWaspObject.ShapeArray** which is an array of TRSObjectShape.
This record holds information about the shape of a TWaspObject

* **TRSObjectShape.TileArray**

  TileArray is a TPointArray holding the tiles of a TWaspObject with **specific Size**. Multiple sized TWaspObjects, e.g. TWaspObjects that are oriented differently throught runescape should be set separately in **TWaspObject.ShapeArray**.

* **TRSObjectShape.Size**

  Size is a TRSObjectSize holding the information about the size and orientation of a TWaspObject. Multiple sized TWaspObjects, e.g. TWaspObjects that are oriented differently throught runescape should be set separately in **TWaspObject.ShapeArray**.

type TRSObjectFilter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TRSObjectFilter is the record used in **TWaspObject.Filter**. This record is used to enable or disable functionality from TWaspObjects.

    MinimapDot: Boolean;
    Finder: Boolean;
    UpText: Boolean;

* **TRSObjectShape.Walker**

  Walker enables/disables TRSWalker for the given TWaspObject.
  When enabled TWaspObjects will use TRSWalker to get the TWaspObject tiles and will then search those tiles for the TWaspObject.
  It's the most accurate way to use TWaspObject but also the slowest. In cases TRSWalker is not needed, it should be disabled for maximum performance.

  Usage
  -----
  .. code-block:: pascal



     WaspObject.Filter.Walker := False;
