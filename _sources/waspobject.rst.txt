WaspObjects
===========
Methods to handle TWaspObjects.
TWaspObjects can be anything that have a shape in the mainscreen.
They are divided in 2 main categories and one of them in 3 sub-categories:
  - RSObjects
  - MMDots:
    -RSNPCs
    -RSGroundItems
    -RSPlayers


------------

type TRSObjectShape
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TRSObjectShape is the record used in **TWaspObject.ShapeArray** which is an array of TRSObjectShape.
This record holds information about the shape of a TWaspObject

* **TRSObjectShape.TileArray**

  TileArray is a TPointArray holding the tiles of a TWaspObject with **specific Size**. Multiple sized TWaspObjects, e.g. TWaspObjects that are oriented differently throught runescape should be set separately in **TWaspObject.ShapeArray**.

* **TRSObjectShape.TileVector**

  TileVector is a Vector3 type holding the information about the size and orientation of a TWaspObject. Multiple sized TWaspObjects, e.g. TWaspObjects that are oriented differently throught runescape should be set separately in **TWaspObject.ShapeArray**.

  TileVector has 3 variables:
    - **X** ( Number of tiles the TWaspObject takes from **West** to **East** )
    - **Y** ( Number of tiles the TWaspObject takes from **North** to **South** )
    - **Z** ( Height of the TWaspObject from the **Floor** to it's **Top**. This value cannot be measured and has to be guessed by trial and error, for reference, a Player or a human NPC height is about **6** )


------------

type TRSObjectFilter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TRSObjectFilter is the record used in **TWaspObject.Filter**. This record is used to enable or disable functionality from TWaspObjects.

    MinimapDot: Boolean;
    Finder: Boolean;
    UpText: Boolean;

* **TRSObjectShape.Walker**

  Walker enables/disables TRSWalker for the given TWaspObject.
  When enabled TWaspObjects will use TRSWalker to get the TWaspObject tiles and will then search those tiles for the TWaspObject.
  It's the most accurate way to use TWaspObject but also the slowest. In cases TRSWalker is not needed, it should be disabled for maximum performance.

  Usage
  -----
  .. code-block:: pascal



     WaspObject.Filter.Walker := False;


------------

type TWaspObject
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TWaspObject is the base record used by **TRSObjects and TRSMMDots**.

* **TWaspObject.Walker**

  Variable holding a **PRSWalker** pointer.

  Usage
  -----
  .. code-block:: pascal



     WaspObject.Walker := @RSW;

* **TWaspObject.ShapeArray**

  ShapeArray holds an array of **TRSObjectShape**.
  You can add as many TRSObjectShape as you want but in reality you should never need more than 2 shapes, one for vertical (north/south) oriented objects and another for horizontal (west/east) oriented ones.

* **TWaspObject.TileArray**

  TileArray holds a **TPointArray**.
  This array should contain all the TPoints stores in every TRSObjectShape.TileArray in TWaspObject.ShapeArray.
  This variable exists so Walker can refer to the TWaspObject location.

  Setup example
  -------------
  .. code-block:: pascal



     for i := 0 to High(ShapeArray) do
       TileArray.Extend(ShapeArray[i].TileArray);

* **TWaspObject.Finder**

  Finder holds a **TRSObjectFinder**.
  It is used to find the TWaspObject on the mainscreen.
  For more information refer to: https://ollydev.github.io/SRL-Development/mainscreen.html#type-trsobjectfinder

* **TWaspObject.UpText**

  UpText holds a **TStringArray** with strings of the TWaspObject up text.

  Usage
  -----
  .. code-block:: pascal



     WaspObject.UpText := ['Banker'];
     Writeln MainScreen.IsUpText(WaspObject.UpText);

* **TWaspObject.Filter**

  Filter holds a **TRSObjectFilter**.

type TRSObject
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TRSObject is a **TWaspObject** specific for objects that do not have a minimap dot.
They can be used for objects with a minimap dot that do not move but **TRSMMDot** gives you more flexibility for those.


------------

type TRSMMDot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TRSMMDot is a **TWaspObject** specific for objects that have a minimap dot.
There's 3 types of TRSMMDot:
  - TRSNPC
  - TRSGroundItem
  - TRSPlayer

Each one made to handle each type of TRSMMDot.
