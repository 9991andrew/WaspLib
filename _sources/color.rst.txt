type SRLColors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Type that holds a large amount of color wrappers so you don't have to memorize then.

Some colors are duplicated. They are kept for easy name access.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: pascal  

  WriteLn SRLColors.BLACK;
  WriteLn SRLColors.ORANGE;
  WriteLn SRLColors.BLUE;

GetNextCycleColor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: pascal

 function GetNextCycleColor(color, step: Int32): Int32;

Not currently used for anything, just a fun experiment. Can be used to give an RGB cycle effect.
