TWaspObject
===========
Methods to handle TWaspObjects.
TWaspObjects can be anything that have a shape in the mainscreen.
They are divided in 2 main categories and one of them in 3 sub-categories:
  - RSObjects
  - MMDots:
    -RSNPCs
    -RSGroundItems
    -RSPlayers


------------

type TRSObjectShape
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TRSObjectShape is the record used in **TWaspObject.ShapeArray** which is an array of TRSObjectShape.
This record holds information about the shape of a TWaspObject

* **TRSObjectShape.TileArray**

  TileArray is a TPointArray holding the tiles of a TWaspObject with **specific Size**. Multiple sized TWaspObjects, e.g. TWaspObjects that are oriented differently throught runescape should be set separately in **TWaspObject.ShapeArray**.

* **TRSObjectShape.TileVector**

  TileVector is a Vector3 type holding the information about the size and orientation of a TWaspObject. Multiple sized TWaspObjects, e.g. TWaspObjects that are oriented differently throught runescape should be set separately in **TWaspObject.ShapeArray**.

  TileVector has variables:
    - **X** ( Number of tiles the TWaspObject takes from **West** to **East** )
    - **Y** ( Number of tiles the TWaspObject takes from **North** to **South** )
    - **Z** ( Height of the TWaspObject from the **Floor** to it's **Top**. This value cannot be measured and has to be guessed by trial and error, for reference, a Player or a human NPC height is about **6** )

type TRSObjectFilter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TRSObjectFilter is the record used in **TWaspObject.Filter**. This record is used to enable or disable functionality from TWaspObjects.

    MinimapDot: Boolean;
    Finder: Boolean;
    UpText: Boolean;

* **TRSObjectShape.Walker**

  Walker enables/disables TRSWalker for the given TWaspObject.
  When enabled TWaspObjects will use TRSWalker to get the TWaspObject tiles and will then search those tiles for the TWaspObject.
  It's the most accurate way to use TWaspObject but also the slowest. In cases TRSWalker is not needed, it should be disabled for maximum performance.

  Usage
  -----
  .. code-block:: pascal



     WaspObject.Filter.Walker := False;
