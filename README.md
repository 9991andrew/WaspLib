# WaspLib
 WaspLib is a include for Simba to bot OldSchool RuneScape.
 It's intended to work with Simba 1400 and SRL-Development, specifically my master branch of SRL-Development.
 Most things should work with the official SRL-Development but honestly, is not tested.
 
 
# What is WaspLib for?
 As I mentioned earlier, WaspLib is a include for Simba to bot OldSchool RuneScape. It's purpose is to make writting scripts faster as it includes lot's of commonly used code throughout my scripts.
 Some things in WaspLib could be coming to SRL in the future but others are just too custom to ever be accepted there and will remain here.
